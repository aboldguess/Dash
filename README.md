# Dash Workplace Platform

This is a prototype of a browser based productivity platform. It exposes multiple modules (Messaging, CRM, Project management, Timesheets and Leave) within a single interface. Each module is accessible via tabs.

## Running locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `node server.js`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

The prototype uses a simple Node/Express server to serve static files under `public/`.
